=     ...  bound once, matched next
''    ... can be used for atoms
""    ... for strings
BIFs  ... Built-In Functions (not actually written in erlang)
          Used in guard scope (they're so close to the VM)
          Cannot call just any function in a guard clause (well, NIFs...)

clever usage of periods can keep some functions "private"
a good practice is not going beyond two levels of indentation (cases, etc.)
