=     ...  bound once, matched next
''    ... can be used for atoms
""    ... for strings
BIFs  ... Built-In Functions (not actually written in erlang)
          Used in guard scope (they're so close to the VM)
          Cannot call just any function in a guard clause (well, NIFs...)

clever usage of periods can keep some functions "private"
a good practice is not going beyond two levels of indentation (cases, etc.)

pman:start(). ... for processes
appmon:start(). ... for applications

erlang/otp handles releases and management of distributed systems right out of the box (but you knew that already)

"building large systems with erlang" ... the book that has yet to be written
